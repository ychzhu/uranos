MCNP6.2@ENDF8 CRN spectra:
- 1002 bins per spectrum, 121 values for soil moisture and air humidity each
- 1st row: energy bin lower value in MeV
- other rows: permutations of air humidity [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 27, 35] in g/m^3 and soil moisture [1, 3, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50] in Vol% for a bulk density of 1.43 g/cm^3
- for each soil moisture value the series of air humidity values is traversed. The first spectrum is 1% and 1 g/m^3, the second 1% and 2 g/m^3, the twelveth 3% and 1 g/m^3

Sato spectra:
Exemplary evaluations of EXPACs 4.08+ for sea level default NTP conditions with the columns energy [MeV] and flux [not normalized].
